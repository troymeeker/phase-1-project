phase 1 project 
Name: 
Beer O'Clock

Description:
This is a basic application used to find and filter breweries in the state of Oregon by city location. By entering a city name in Oregon, and submitting the form, the data will fetch and filter the breweries in that city. 
The arrow buttons will help navigate between pages of breweries (6 pages in total), and an alert will notify you if you try to move past the final page. 
If a city has more than 50 breweries, the "More Breweries in this city" button will append the next (up to) 50 breweries in that city.
